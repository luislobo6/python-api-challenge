On each folder (WeatherPy and VacationPy) add a file called api_keys.py with the key for google requests with the name of g_key



# Conclusions from WeatherPy


* I think that for better conclusions we missed one important variable, as it is altitude from each city, becaus also that affects the weather and apparently there is certain correlation on the latitude and the temperature, but it is not so clear, we have cities near the ecuator that are also "cold", but we can say that closer to the ecuator is hotter in general

* There are more cities on the north part of the emisphere and that could get us a better statistic for the linear regression, but with few data it seems that the variables checked are comparable in the north part and in the south part of the hemisphere.

* There is no direct correlation on the Wind Speed and the Latitude or the Cloudiness and Latitude
